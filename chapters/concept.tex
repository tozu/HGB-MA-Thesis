\section{Overview}
Traditionally sensors, such as RADAR, LIDAR and cameras are used to detect 
- sensors (radar, lidar), basically LOS) not sufficient enough

not detected in timely manner
    % {Implementation and Evaluation of a Cooperative Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Safety Application}
poor visibility conditions, i.e. night, bad weather
    % {Vehicle to pedestrian communications for protection of vulnerable road users}
hilly, cureved roads
    % {Elastic band based pedestrian collision avoidance using V2X communication}
not close enough (LOS)

V2X is omnidirectional, effective range of 500m and capable of two-way-information sharing by nature
