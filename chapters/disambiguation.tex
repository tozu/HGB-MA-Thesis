\section{Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)}
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) apply information and communication technologies to vehicles, transportation infrastructure and its users aiming to provide services to enhance road safety, mobility and traffic efficiency. % goals

% .... 


% ...ITS not only for road vehicles
Initially ITS have been only apparent in the road transport domain, yet began to appear in other domains such as in maritime and rail transport. % proof?
This development lead to expansion of ITS original ``Fundamental services'' which have been defined in the international standard ISO 141813-1 in 1999. % citation
With the most recent version (2016), ITS are now expected to address the following service domains:

% service domains (where each holds different service groups)
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traveler information
        \item Traffic management\\and operations
        \item Vehicle services
        \item Freight transport
        \item Public transport
        \item Emergency
        \columnbreak

        \item Disaster response management\\and coordination
        \item National security.
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

While ITS offer services to different domains, generally ITS services are about enhancing the driving experience. ITS can exist without intercommunication with other ITS or other vehicles, such as \textit{lane departure warning systems} and \textit{adaptive cruise control} that use technologies like video pattern recognition and radar to provide assistance to the driver. \cite{} % Intelligent Transport Systems Standards by Bob Williams

However, \textbf{Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems} (C-ITS) are the most promising technology to contribute to ``improving road safety by avoiding accidents and reducing their severity, to decreasing congestion, by optimising performance and available capacity of existing road transport infrastructure, to enhancing vehicle fleet management, by increasing travel time reliability and to reducing energy use and negative environmental impact''.
% EU - Deployment and Operation of European Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS)
The emphasis of C-ITS lays on the term ``coperative'' which highlights the ability to communicate and share information with other vehicles and/or infrastructure, in order to increase their awareness about their surroundings.
To achieve this a proper, standardized communication architecture is required. In Europe, the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) administers this process based on advisements by the Car-2-Car (C2C) Communication Consortium\footnote{Website Car-2-Car Communication Consortium: \url{https://car-2-car.org/}}.
The C2C consortium is compromised of leading vehicle manufacturers, equipment suppliers, research organizations and other partners who focus ``on creating standards ensuring the interoperability of cooperative systems spanning all vehicles classes, across borders and brands''\cite{}. % source flyer
C-ITS and a successful standardization process are necessary for the future of automated, driverless vehicles and their integration into the global transportation system.

ITS applications and services that utilize sensors are already an extensive contribution for vehicles themselves, yet their scope are even more auxiliary and beneficial for other proximate entities when applicable sensor information are shared using real-time messages.
% 
% examples C-ITS application???
% 
% ITS applications are initially grouped into "Road Safety", "Traffic Efficiency" and "Other Applications" ref: EN 302 655 (chap 5.1.)
% 
Subsequently, a vehicular communication system has been developed during the ITS standardization process which allows the bidirectional message exchange between vehicles and any entity that may affect it.
Based on the vehicle's information exchange with other entities this communication is commonly referred to as ``Vehicle-to-everything'' (V2X) communication.
The underlying technology of V2X communication creates a wireless connection between the communicating vehicle and entity, by either establishing a dedicated short range (DSRC) or cellular-based (C-V2X) connection.
