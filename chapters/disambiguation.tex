\section{Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)}
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) apply information and communication technologies to vehicles, transportation infrastructure and its users aiming to provide services to enhance road safety, mobility and traffic efficiency. % goals

% .... 


% ...ITS not only for road vehicles
Initially ITS have been only apparent in the road transport domain, yet began to appear in other domains such as in maritime and rail transport. % proof?
This development lead to expansion of ITS original ``Fundamental services'' which have been defined in the international standard ISO 141813-1 in 1999. % citation
With the most recent version (2016), ITS are now expected to address the following service domains:

% service domains (where each holds different service groups)
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traveler information
        \item Traffic management\\and operations
        \item Vehicle services
        \item Freight transport
        \item Public transport
        \item Emergency
        \columnbreak
        \item Transport-related electronic\\payment
        \item Road transport-related\\personal safety
        \item Weather and environmental\\conditions monitoring
        \item Disaster response management\\and coordination
        \item National security.
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

While ITS offer services to different domains, generally ITS services are about enhancing the driving experience. ITS can exist without intercommunication with other ITS or other vehicles, such as \textit{lane departure warning systems} and \textit{adaptive cruise control} that use technologies like video pattern recognition and radar to provide assistance to the driver. \cite{} % Intelligent Transport Systems Standards by Bob Williams

% Difference C-ITS vs ITS
% The main difference between C-ITS applications and conventional ITS applications is that C- ITS applications rely on common communication architecture between all connected entities allowing them to exchange all type of information

However, \textbf{Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems} (C-ITS) are the most promising technology to contribute to ``improving road safety by avoiding accidents and reducing their severity, to decreasing congestion, by optimising performance and available capacity of existing road transport infrastructure, to enhancing vehicle fleet management, by increasing travel time reliability and to reducing energy use and negative environmental impact''.
% EU - Deployment and Operation of European Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS)
The emphasis of C-ITS lays on the term ``coperative'' which highlights the ability to communicate and share information with other vehicles and/or infrastructure, in order to increase their awareness about their surroundings.
To achieve this a proper, standardized communication architecture is required. In Europe, the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) administers this process based on advisements by the Car-2-Car (C2C) Communication Consortium\footnote{Website Car-2-Car Communication Consortium: \url{https://car-2-car.org/}}.
The C2C consortium is compromised of leading vehicle manufacturers, equipment suppliers, research organizations and other partners who focus ``on creating standards ensuring the interoperability of cooperative systems spanning all vehicles classes, across borders and brands''\cite{}. % source flyer
C-ITS and a successful standardization process are necessary for the future of automated, driverless vehicles and their integration into the global transportation system.

ITS applications and services that utilize sensors are already an extensive contribution for vehicles themselves, yet their scope are even more auxiliary and beneficial for other proximate entities when applicable sensor information are shared using real-time messages.
Subsequently, a vehicular communication system has been developed during the ITS standardization process which allows the bidirectional message exchange between vehicles and any entity that may affect it.
Based on the vehicle's information exchange with other entities this communication is called ``Vehicle-to-everything'' (V2X) communication.

% mention diff. V2X technologies
The underlying technology of V2X communication creates a wireless connection between the communicating vehicle and entity, by either establishing a WiFi or cellular-based connection.

% TODO correct!!!
\textbf{In the United States this kind of WiFi-based connection is commonly referred to and has been standardized as 'dedicated short range connection' (DSRC), whereas in Europe an equivalent standard emerged and is named 'ITS-G5'.} Their cellular correspondent is called cellular V2X (C-V2X) communication and uses 3G, LTE or soon, with it's impending introduction, 5G networks.
A more in-depth look at mentioned V2X communication technologies is provided in section \ref{sec:v2xtech}.

% Transition to ITS Stations
ITS applications are distributed over several ITS stations, which interact together to satisfy a large diversity of services. % ETSI TS 102 637-1
Such ITS stations are equipped with multiple communication capabilities, which vary depending on the ITS station's type. The ETSI distinguishes between four different types of ITS stations: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Central ITS station,
    \item Roadside ITS station,
    \item Vehicle ITS station and
    \item Personal ITS station.
\end{itemize}

% Central ITS station
\noindent A central ITS station is an organizational entity, which operates centrally managed ITS applications and services.
This includes traffic management centers that control and monitor roadside infrastructure, fleet management centers as well as any service or content provider that distributes information (via roadside components) to other ITS stations.

% connections
Central ITS station are known to have both a wireless and wired connection.
% -- wireless to communicate directly with ITS (uncommon)
The wireless connection is to communicate directly with vehicle ITS station

% -- wired connection
Whereas the wired connection is 
used to communicate with roadside units, but also with backend

Vehicles, or yet more commonly, roadside infrastructure components send information to the central component, which in return, may responds similarly by sending information back to vehicles or roadside infrastructure.

The information exchange is accomplished using 
This information exchange is achieved, transmitted,

Central ITS systems are not 
not limited by the spanned V2X network, yet might be connected to o

% -- wired (backend)
not necessarily a closed network system, yet it might be connect to
may include other backend systems and services to provide additional information.

It is a common occurrence that central ITS stations are connected to wired networks, to include backend systems and services, that are necessary to provide additional information.

% {example Central ITS station} ?
% service provider (parking system: free, occupied space; toll: payment)



% {Roadside ITS station}
%     - roadside (provides independently or cooperatively applications for central or other roadside ITS stations)

example roadside like ...
Road side ITS station (RSU) is installed on the motorway ramp to monitor road section on end of the ramp. The ITS station takes images from the road section with stereo camera and calculates road weather type with IcOR software developed by VTT

located in the roadside infrastructure

% Vehicle ITS station
%     - vehicle (provides application for driver and/or passengers. may require access to vehicle system e.g. CAN)

Vehicle ITS station a mobile device can be seen as an additional HMI for the driver, passenger or codriver. In that case the mobile device acts as a display device echoing interface elements for the user. It displays icons, texts and plays audio tones triggered and is commanded by the Application Unit (AU).

% use cases, in which applications there used

The CA basic service is a facilities layer entity that operates the CAM protocol. It provides two services: sending and receiving of CAMs.

notify presence of vehicle/road side station

CAM contains status and attribute information of the originating ITS-S.
The content varies depending on the type of the ITS-S.
information includes data about the dimensions, vehicle type and role in the road traffic, etc.


% CAM generation specs:
CAMs are generated periodically 
CAM generation frequency: 100 - 1000 ms (or 1-10Hz)
depending on dynamics and the channel congestion status

sent single hop
direct communication range.

CAM generation time shall be less than 50ms

new CAM must only be generated if the state has changed significantly


with received CAM calculate a local dynamic traffic map (LDM)

    geographic position
    speed
    driving direction (heading)

incl. confidence levels of
    heading,
    speed,
